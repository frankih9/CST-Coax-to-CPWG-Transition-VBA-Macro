# CST-Coax-to-CPWG-Transition-VBA-Macro
Hopefully CST will not use VBA/Macro as the basis of its scripting in future releases.

The purpose of this VBA/Macro is to automate the consturction of a multilayer PCB, via placements, and a vertical coaxial connector.  The resulting structure contain parameters which can be used in a swept simulation for optimization.
